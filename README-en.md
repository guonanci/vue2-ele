# Introduction

[Chine README](README.md)

I use the latest vue2 tech stack, and webpack4 to build this app. It matters a lot if you want to research vue and webpack. In practice, you may often see shopping cart page(because its relative to money, and its logically tight), sign in, sign up, personal page(personal infomation page) and so on, often used.

The project is strongly functional, though not beautiful as a music player, but also with enough complexity and challengeable. And it imitates the elm app, so there are lots of food, and appetizing.

And also, its tone, layout is very nice, suple, and comfortable.

This project includes 45 pages, involving sign up, sign in, commodity displaying, shopping cart, order and so on. This is an entire process, and full of challenges!

Currently, this project is doing some performance optimization, and will so add some neccessary, brief code comments.

The project does not involve any commercial activity, so if you want to have a takeaway, please go to elm channel in taobao app~

## About API
[Node backend system](htttps://github.com/guonanci/elm-node) supports the same API with official elm app. In the meantime, we support a [pc manage system](https://github.com/guonanci/elm-manage) based on elment-ui.
